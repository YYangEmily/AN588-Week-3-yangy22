## What is the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?
```{r Question 1}
x <- 8:30
l = 15
probset <- ppois(x, l, lower.tail = FALSE)
barplot(probset, names.arg = x, space = 0, xlab = "Number of Calls", ylab = "Probability", main = "Probability of more than 8 calls")
x1<- sum(probset)
x1
```
## What is the probability that she will hear no calls in a session?
```{r Question 2}
y <- 0
l = 15
probset1 <- dpois(y, l)
barplot(probset1, names.arg = y, space = 0, xlab = "Number of Calls", ylab = "Probability", main = "Probability of 0 calls")
probset1
```

## What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session?
```{r Question 3}
z <- 3
l = 15
probset2 <- dpois(z, l)
barplot(probset2, names.arg = z, space = 0, xlab = "Number of Calls", ylab = "Probability", main = "Probability of 3 calls")
probset2
```

## Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30

```{r Question 4}
a <- 0:30
l = 15
probset3 <- dpois(a, l)
barplot(probset3, names.arg = a, space = 0, xlab = "Number of Calls", ylab = "Probability", main = "Poisson mass function")
```

## Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions).
``` {r Question 5}
b <- rpois(104, 15)

```
## Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30. How does your histogram compare to the shape of the probability mass function you plotted above?
``` {r Question 6}
hist(b, xlim = c(0,30))

```

The histogram is grouped closer to the center of the distribution that the probability mass function plotted above.
