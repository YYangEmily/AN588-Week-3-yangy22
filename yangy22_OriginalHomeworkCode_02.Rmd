## What is the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?
```{r Question 1}
x <- 9:30
l = 15
probset <- ppois(x, l, lower.tail = FALSE) #ppois gives cumulative probability. 
# lower.tail = TRUE cumulative probability that there will be x or fewer successes.
# lower.tail = FALSE cumulative probability that there will be more than x successes.

barplot(probset, names.arg = x, space = 0, xlab = "Number of Calls", ylab = "Probability", main = " Cumulative Probability of more than 8 calls")

probset[1] # probability that she will hear 9 or more calls. 
```
## What is the probability that she will hear no calls in a session?
```{r Question 2}
y <- 0
l = 15
probset1 <- dpois(y, l) #dpois the probability that there will be x successes
barplot(probset1, names.arg = y, space = 0, xlab = "Number of Calls", ylab = "Probability", main = "Probability of 0 calls")
probset1 # probability of hearing zero calls
```

## What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session?
```{r Question 3}
z <- 3
l = 15
probset2 <- dpois(z, l)
barplot(probset2, names.arg = z, space = 0, xlab = "Number of Calls", ylab = "Probability", main = "Probability of 3 calls")
probset2 # probability of hearing 3 calls
```

## Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30

```{r Question 4}
a <- 0:30
l = 15
probset3 <- dpois(a, l) # probabilities of number of calls from 0 to 30
barplot(probset3, names.arg = a, space = 0, xlab = "Number of Calls", ylab = "Probability", main = "Poisson mass function")
```

## Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions).
``` {r Question 5}
b <- rpois(104, 15) # rpois(n, lambda). n is number of trials

```
## Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30. How does your histogram compare to the shape of the probability mass function you plotted above?
``` {r Question 6}
hist(b, xlim = c(0,30), main = "104 Simulated Sessions", xlab = "Number of Calls", ylab = "Number of Sessions" )

```

The histogram is grouped closer to the center of the distribution that the probability mass function plotted above. It does not have any successes below 5 or above 25.
